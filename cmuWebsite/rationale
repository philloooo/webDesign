My idea for the home page is to make it simple and clear, with all the important points but exclude trivial and distracting information.
My laptop version contains 5 parts: Header, Nav bar, Top news, News and events, sessions, footer. The nav bar include information that I think people outside of cmu (rather than student) is most concerned about. While I group all information in the home page of cmu into 6 sessions. For example, 'people' session directs you to the page where you can get information for prospective students, current students, alumni, etc.

The tablet version collapseis the Top news, News and events into one category, where news are just different slides.

The phone version changes the nav bar to be in menu icon, and change the layout of sessions to 2*3.
